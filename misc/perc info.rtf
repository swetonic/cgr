\f0\fs24 \cf0 Alternatives to perchloroethylene\
\
The standard chemical used in drycleaning is perchloroethylene (commonly called perc), a chemical that produces toxic waste, and is classified as a probable human carcinogen and Toxic Air Contaminant by the United States Environmental Protection Agency\uc0\u8206  (EPA).[2] There are roughly 30-35,000 dry cleaning establishments in the United States. [3] Perchloroethylene has been the solvent of choice for drycleaners since the 1950s (more than 80% of dry cleaners in the United States use it). Concerns about perc were first raised by the scientific community in the 1970\'92s, but viable alternatives did not exist until the late 1990s.[4] In January 2007, the California Air Resources Board passed the nation\'92s first statewide ban on perc, initiating a 15 year phase-out of chemicals and equipment. [5] Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey are considering similar bans.[6]}
