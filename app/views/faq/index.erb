<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>
<%= render :partial => 'q' %> Just what is eco-friendly dry cleaning?
<p>
<%= render :partial => 'a' %> Over 90% of the dry cleaners in the country 
use a toxic chemical called perchloroethylene, or "PERC." PERC has health 
risks to workers and can contaminate nearby soil and ground water. 
Clothes, after being cleaned with PERC, continue to off-gas PERC into your home. 
Your clothes have a chemical smell; your house has a chemical smell. 

<p>

<%= render :partial => 'q' %> What makes your process so much greener?
<p>
<%= render :partial => 'a' %> We use a hydrocarbon-based solvent that is 
odorless and has no known health hazard, and no known environmental hazard. 

<p>

<%= render :partial => 'q' %> But does it work? Is it safe for my clothes?
<p>
<%= render :partial => 'a' %> Yes, and yes! The hydrocarbon-based solvent 
we use has been in use since 1994, and has proven to be safe on all fabrics and 
tough on stains.
<p>

<%= render :partial => 'q' %> What else makes you so revolutionary?
<p>
<%= render :partial => 'a' %> We have looked at every step of the dry cleaning 
process from start to finish to find opportunities to reduce, reuse, and recycle. 
We limit the use of extra paper and packaging, and we promote recycling of your 
hangers and bags. We even offer a premium service that returns your clothes to 
you in reusable garment bags.
<p>

<%= render :partial => 'q' %> This sounds good, but is it expensive?
<p>
<%= render :partial => 'a' %> Our cleaning methods utilize tried and true 
technology, unlike newer unproven technologies that are expensive and have an 
unproven track record. That means we can deliver quality service at competitive 
prices - a true value for your family.
<p>

<%= render :partial => 'q' %> Sounds great. How do I sign up?
<p>
<%= render :partial => 'a' %>Easy!
